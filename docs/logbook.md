# Log book for CellosaurusBot updates.

## 19/11/2020
* Added link to specific CLO ID property in place of exact match.
* Ran __prepare_files.py__ for Release 36.

## 21/11/2020
* The updates stopped running, last cell line was CVCL_LG07 (Q54872068). I will create a new dump from this cell to the end called `int_cellosaurus.txt`. If that happens again, I'll update the same file.
* I restarted the updates with the new file. It is running normally.


## 24/11/2020
* Finished running the Cellosaurus bot for the release 36.


## 05/12/2020
* Run check_lines_on_wikidata again to account for minor changes (namely to create (CVCL_A9Z3 and CVCL_A9ZA).
* Add exact match statements for those cells that have only CLO ID

## 15/02/2021
* Start run for release 37
* Old "Found in Taxon" statements are kept for now. They will need to be removed in a clean-up step at a later point.

## 17/02/2021
* Stopped run for release 37 at CVCL_P465 (I am going to be without good connection in the next few days, and I haven't set a server to run it)

## 22/02/2021
* Started running the CellosaurusBot once more.

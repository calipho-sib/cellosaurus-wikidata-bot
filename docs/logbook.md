# Log book for CellosaurusBot updates.


## 19/11/2020
* Added link to specific CLO ID property in place of exact match.
* Ran __prepare_files.py__ for Release 36.

## 21/11/2020
* The updates stopped running, last cell line was CVCL_LG07 (Q54872068). I will create a new dump from this cell to the end called `int_cellosaurus.txt`. If that happens again, I'll update the same file.
* I restarted the updates with the new file. It is running normally.
